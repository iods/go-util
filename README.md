Util - Common Utilities for Go
==============================

The `go-util` package is a set of composable utilities, libraries, and shared code I am coding with
for common things in Go. It is still a WIP.

These are wrappers and base containers for making common tasks faster and less repetitive for building
CLIs to enterprise. They are packaged individually for tooling.

> **WARNING:** This is a private package and is not currently maintained for public use.
